## What is in the folder

This folder contains the simulation results for optimal solution of two models presented in the appendix of the paper, as well as the files needed for the postprocesing of each model. Simulation results are stored in the ```*.csv``` files and then used in the scripts for [figures_replication](../../../figures_replication).

## How to analyze the pre-computed solutions

For details regarding the postprocessing of appendix results, please go to the README [here](../README.md).

To replicate graphs that are presented in the paper, please refer to [here](../../../figures_replication).
