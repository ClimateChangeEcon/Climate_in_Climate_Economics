## What is in the folder

This folder contains the simulation results for the business-as-usual solution of the models, as well as the files needed for the postprocesing of each model. Simulation results are stored in the ```*.csv``` files and then used in the scripts for [figures_replication](../../../figures_replication).

## How to analyze the pre-computed solutions

For details regarding the postprocessing of business-as-usual results, please go to the README [here](../README.md).

To replicate graphs that are presented in the paper, please refer to [here](../../../figures_replication).
